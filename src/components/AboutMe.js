      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently enrolled in University of Washington full stack web
        development program to be completed May of 2022. I was born and
        raised in Seattle, Washington and being surrounded by many tech
        companies and opportunities sparked an interest in learning to code!
        In my journey so far I have had hands on experience learning HTML,
        CSS, Javascript, API's, and Node.
        Outside of
        development, my other interests include real estate/investing,
        travelling, and interior design.
