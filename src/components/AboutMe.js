      <p>
       
        I am currently enrolled in University of Washington full stack web developement program! I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. Being surrounded by many tech companies and opportunities sparked an interest in learning to code. In my journey so far I have had hands on experience learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, API's, Sequelize, Node, Handlebars, MonoDB, and react. I am horrible at writing these so I will write a better one later.
